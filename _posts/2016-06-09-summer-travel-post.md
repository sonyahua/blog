Just finished an intense semester of Statistics at Baruch and looking forward to the free time this summer. Also, have planned an amazing month-long trip throughout Middle East and Southeast Asia with my beau and family. In total, visiting 7 countries and 10 cities. I have been looking forward to this trip for a while now, and can't believe we are weeks away from being <b> "weeks away!" </b>
