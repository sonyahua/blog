>As a student of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program, I completed a project which required programming in Python/Javascript/HTML/CSS to create a webpage filled with my most recent favorite movies. This project uses the Movie Database API to pull in movie info in order to populate the webpage. To learn more, please see [my previous post](http://www.sonyahua.com/2016/08/30/parsing-API-using-JSON.html) on using deserializing JSON responses from API's.

This project is located in my github repository [movies](https://github.com/sonyahua/movies). For instructions on how to load the webpage, please read the README file.
