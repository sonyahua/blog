This site is a "for fun" collection of my off-time work, illustrations, and musings as I learn data visualization, statistics, and consequently web development. Since it's for fun and focused more so on the journey than any end product, you may expect random interruptions regarding my other intermediate interests such as exploring NYC, cooking, reading, and tending to my urban greenhouse project on my down time.

##Stay Tuned!
